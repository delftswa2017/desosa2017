# Contributing to DESOSA 2017

To be able to contribute to this repository, fork this repository on your personal account and submit a pull request on your fork.
To avoid conflicts when merging the chapters we kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when submitting a chapter.

## Naming conventions
Your Pull Request should contain the following;

```
delftswa2017/desosa2017
|_ [team]
   |_ images-[team]
   |_ chapter.md
```

Where `[team]` should be replaced by the name as mentioned in your teams' repository: `team-youtube-dl` would need to create a folder `youtube-dl` and an images folder `images-youtube-dl`. You can check that the name is right by comparing with the [SUMMARY.md] file.

Some points to take into account:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that your **image paths** will still work once the files have been merged into master!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that **GitBook** does not throw any warnings or errors!
- ‚úÖ All **authors** mentioned in the chapter?
- ‚úÖ All image / table / literature **references** are correct / working?
- ‚úÖ All text checked for **spelling / grammar** mistakes?

[SUMMARY.md]: https://github.com/delftswa2017/desosa2017/blob/master/SUMMARY.md

## What's next?

The course staff will review your chapter / changes as soon as possible. When you receive a sufficient score for publication you will be asked to indicate whether you would like to proceed with the publication in the book. When your grade is not sufficient, you will get the chance to improve based on the feedback and submit again.
